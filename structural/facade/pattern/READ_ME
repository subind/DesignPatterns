Facade general meaning :-
"the way somebody/something appears to be, which is not the way he/she/it really is"

What is the Facade Pattern?
* It creates a single, unified interface (the "facade") to simplify access to complex subsystems.
* Internally, it delegates tasks to the appropriate components of the subsystem, hiding the complexity from the client code.

Why Use the Facade Pattern in Android Development?
Simplify Complex Codebases:
Android apps often have multiple modules (e.g., networking, database, UI rendering). A facade can provide a clean API for these modules.

Improve Maintainability:
By hiding implementation details, you can refactor the internal workings of subsystems without affecting client code.

Reduce Coupling:
Subsystems remain loosely coupled to the client code, which improves testability and modularity.

Enhance Readability:
Reduces the need to understand the entire subsystem; developers can work with a simpler interface.
