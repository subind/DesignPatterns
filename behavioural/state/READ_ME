Intro :-
The objects behaviour is changed, when its internal state changes.

In our example the object is MediaPlayer.
It's internal state is maintained by its currentState variable.

All the concrete state implementors have the same 3 methods, whose functions are unique.

Therefore if the user invokes any one of the 3 functions of the MediaPlayer, whose implementations are unique for each concrete state.
The behaviour that is executed depends upon it's current internal state.


Benefits :-
Encapsulation of Behavior:
    Encapsulates state-specific logic into separate classes, making the code easier to manage.
Single Responsibility:
    Separates concerns between states and the context.
Flexibility:
    Allows adding new states without modifying existing states or the context.
Avoids Large Conditional Statements:
    Replaces complex if or switch statements with polymorphism.
